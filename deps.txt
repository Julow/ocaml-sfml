Informations about relationships between objects of the SFML lib.

When object A uses object B, does B have to stay arround or may it be deleted?
(we need these informations to handle correctly garbage collected values)

- Sound  should keep a reference to its SoundBuffer
- String should keep a reference to its Font
- Sprite should keep a reference to its Image
- PostFx should keep references to all its Images given with SetTexture
- Window should keep a reference to its Input
- RenderWindow should keep a reference to its Input
- RenderWindow should keep a reference to its CurrentView and its DefaultView
